# mpv-cards

Mux of mpvacious and mpv-nihongo/LaT in Typescript with particular features I want. Notably, subtitles are stored as they arrive which allows for grabbing multiple lines without using the built-in mpv sub-seek command. This project also allows for updating multiple cards at once instead of manually updating for each note in a sentence with multiple unknown words.
